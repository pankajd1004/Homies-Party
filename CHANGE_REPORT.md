# Change Report: Classic Board Games (Ludo, Snakes & Ladders, Carrom, and Battleship)

## Summary of Changes
1. **UI/UX Redesign STEP 1 — Shared Design Layer & Home Screen (`lib/ui/`, `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)**:
   - **Shared Design Layer (`lib/ui/`)**:
     - `app_palette.dart`: Cohesive palette featuring dark obsidian/slate background gradient (`#0F172A` to `#070B18`), 4 vibrant game accents (Ludo `#3B82F6`, Snakes & Ladders `#10B981`, Carrom `#F59E0B`, Battleship `#06B6D4`), semantic colors (success, warning, danger), and glass/surface constants.
     - `app_text_styles.dart`: Complete type scale (`title`, `heading`, `subheading`, `body`, `bodyBold`, `button`, `caption`, `badge`) with strong weights, readable sizing, and polished letter spacing using default system fonts.
     - `app_button.dart`: Reusable `AppButton` with primary, secondary, and danger variants, refined gradient fill, rounded shape (16px), soft shadow, press scale animation (<120ms), disabled state, loading spinner, light haptic feedback (`HapticFeedback.lightImpact()`), and 500ms double-tap debounce.
     - `app_back_button.dart`: Round glassmorphic back button (42×42) with press scale animation (<120ms) and light haptics.
     - `app_card.dart`: Reusable card with 20px rounded corners, customizable gradient fill, soft layered glow shadow, and press scale animation (<120ms).
     - `app_dialog.dart`: Standalone styled modal dialog frame helper for future steps (not applied to any existing game dialogs).
     - `app_transitions.dart`: Short, smooth custom page transition (`AppPageRoute` / `appPageRoute`) combining gentle slide (0.05 offset) and fade over 250ms with ease-out cubic curve.
   - **Home Screen Redesign (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)**:
     - Complete redesign featuring `_HomeScreenHeader` with collection badge, refined app title, subtitle, and `LayoutBuilder` responsive padding.
     - 4 elegant game cards (`home_ludo_card`, `home_snl_card`, `home_carrom_card`, `home_battleship_card`) built with `AppCard`, custom gradients, glowing icons, category tags, taglines, and tactile press animations.
     - Uses `appPageRoute` for smooth navigation transitions.
     - 100% backward compatible: preserves every existing navigation target, key, and behavior.
   - **Mode-Selection Screens Visual Styling (Visual Polish Only)**:
     - Styled `LudoModeSelectScreen`, `CarromModeSelectScreen`, and `BattleshipModeSelectScreen` using `AppPalette.backgroundGradient`, `AppBackButton`, `AppCard`, `AppTextStyles`, and `appPageRoute`.
     - Preserved every existing callback, parameter, mode constructor, and test key (`ludo_mode_back_button`, `ludo_mode_multiplayer`, `ludo_mode_vs_computer`, `carrom_mode_back_button`, `carrom_mode_2players`, `carrom_mode_vs_computer`, `battleship_mode_back_button`, `battleship_mode_multiplayer`, `battleship_mode_vs_computer`).
   - **Zero Disruptions to Game Work**:
     - No game screen, game widget, controller, model, game rules, physics, scoring, turn logic, or computer player code was touched.
     - No external packages or image assets added.
   - **Tests Added**:
     - `test/app_button_test.dart`: Tests tap execution, disabled prevention, double-tap debounce safety, loading state, and variant styling.
     - `test/home_screen_test.dart`: Tests 4 game cards and zero layout overflow across 360×640 (compact), 390×844 (standard), and 412×923 (tall) viewports, plus larger 1.4x accessibility text scaling.

2. **Classic Battleship Implementation (`lib/battleship/`)**:
   - Built a complete, naval radar-themed Battleship game entirely in an isolated `lib/battleship/` directory.
   - **Zero modifications or disruptions** to existing Ludo, Snakes & Ladders, or Carrom code, rules, UI, assets, or tests.
   - **Pure Dart Game Logic**:
     - Complete decoupling: `battleship_config.dart`, `battleship_models.dart`, `battleship_board.dart`, `battleship_computer_player.dart`, `battleship_controller.dart` contain zero Flutter imports.
     - Fleet sizes (Carrier 5, Battleship 4, Cruiser 3, Submarine 3, Destroyer 2) and delays (700ms CPU shot delay) in `battleship_config.dart`.
     - Strict placement rules: 10×10 grid, horizontal/vertical only, bounds validation, overlap prevention.
     - Placement controls: cell tap placement, orientation rotation (H/V), whole-fleet random placement, and reset.
     - Battle firing: alternate firing, single-shot per cell, HIT/MISS feedback, ship sunk notification with ship name.
     - Duel view: Target Radar (firing grid showing hits/misses) and Own Fleet (defense grid showing friendly ships and incoming damage).
   - **Multiplayer Mode (One Phone)**:
     - Full-screen `BattleshipPassPhoneOverlay` ("Pass the phone to Player X. Tap when ready") shielding all ship information between placements and between turns.
     - Complete fog of war: neither player can inspect opponent ship locations.
   - **vs Computer Mode (Fair Play CPU)**:
     - Player 1 = Human, Player 2 = Computer ("CPU").
     - Guaranteed fair play: CPU never inspects human ship coordinates or board.
     - Checkerboard parity hunting `(row + col) % 2 == 0`, adjacent orthogonal targeting after hit, line axis continuation until ship is sunk.
     - Deterministic seeded random source for reproducible tests.
     - 700ms realistic shot delay in config file.
   - **Input Reliability & Lifecycle**:
     - Complete input locking during CPU thinking, processing, and on already-fired cells.
     - Timers safely cancelled on screen disposal, restart, or game over.
   - **UI & Aesthetics**:
     - Naval radar dark-mode aesthetic (`battleship_colors.dart`).
     - Reuses shared `WinnerBanner` from `lib/widgets/winner_banner.dart` without modifying it.
     - Back button (`Icons.arrow_back_ios_new_rounded`) matching existing games.
     - Responsive layout with `SafeArea` and `LayoutBuilder`: verified on 360×640, 390×844, and 412×923 with zero overflows.
   - **Test Results**: 38 new unit and widget tests added. Total tests: **195 (↑ from 157), all passing**, `flutter analyze` 0 issues.

2. **Winner Banner UI (`lib/widgets/winner_banner.dart`, `test/winner_banner_test.dart`)**: Added a shared animated "WINNER!" overlay widget (fade + elastic scale, ~900 ms, `IgnorePointer` so buttons stay tappable). Integrated into Ludo's `GameOverDialog`, SnL's win dialog, and Carrom's game screen with minimal, isolated insertions — no game logic, rules, physics, or existing tests were changed. Total tests: **101 (↑ from 98), all pass**.
3. **Classic Carrom Implementation (`lib/carrom/`)**:
   - Built a complete, clean, mobile-first 2-player local Carrom game entirely in an isolated `lib/carrom/` directory.
   - **Zero modifications or disruptions** to existing Ludo or Snakes & Ladders game code, models, widgets, rules, or tests.
   - **Board and Coins**:
     - 800×800 square virtual coordinate board with 4 corner pockets, outer mahogany frame, baseline for each player, and center circle.
     - 19 coins in standard dense packing: 9 White coins, 9 Black coins, and 1 Red Queen in the center.
     - Player 1 = White (bottom baseline), Player 2 = Black (top baseline).
   - **Shooting Controls**:
     - Current player slides striker along their baseline. Striker cannot overlap active coins or leave legal bounds.
     - Slingshot pull-back aiming gesture with dotted trajectory line, arrowhead, and power arc indicator.
     - Maximum shot power is clamped to prevent physics tunneling or erratic bounces.
   - **Custom 2D Physics Engine (Pure Dart, No External Physics Packages)**:
     - Elastic circle-to-circle collisions with momentum transfer.
     - Border wall bounces with restitution loss.
     - Linear friction and viscous drag for natural deceleration and clean stopping.
     - Pocket detection marking pieces as pocketed when falling within corner pocket radii.
     - Fixed 240Hz sub-stepping preventing tunneling through walls or pieces.
     - 6.0-second safety timeout ensuring the motion phase ends deterministically.
     - Centralized physics configuration in `CarromConfig`.
   - **Rules & Game Logic**:
     - Pocketing own coin awards an extra shot.
     - Pocketing opponent coin scores for opponent and ends the turn.
     - Striker pocketed = Foul: 1 previously pocketed coin is returned to center and turn ends.
     - Queen rules: Pocketing Queen requires covering it with an own coin on the same shot or the very next shot; otherwise Queen returns to the center.
     - Nearest free spot radial search for returned coins when center is occupied.
     - Win condition: First player to pocket all 9 coins of their color and cover the Queen wins.
   - **Reliability & Input Protection**:
     - All user touch gestures are completely locked while pieces are in motion (`simulating` phase).
     - State machine transitions deterministically after all pieces reach a complete stop.

2. **Home Screen Update (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)**:
   - Added a third "Carrom" game option card alongside Ludo and Snakes & Ladders.
   - Wrapped cards in `SingleChildScrollView` with responsive spacing to ensure zero overflow on compact screens.

3. **Responsive Mobile Layout**:
   - Implemented portrait layout with `SafeArea` and `LayoutBuilder`.
   - Dynamic board scaling: `boardSize = math.min(usableWidth, maxBoardFromHeight).clamp(220.0, usableWidth)`.
   - Tested and verified on **360×640**, **390×844**, **412×923**, and **430×932** viewports with **zero RenderFlex overflows**.

## Known Limitations
- **Not tested on a real device**: Testing executed exclusively on the Flutter test environment and Windows desktop runner. Physical Android and iOS device behaviour has not been verified.
- **No sound or haptic feedback**: Audio effects, background audio, and vibration are not implemented.
- **No save / resume**: Matches are held in memory only and reset upon app termination or back navigation.
- **AI in Ludo only**: The CPU player is available for 2-player Ludo ("vs Computer" mode). Snakes & Ladders and Carrom remain pass-and-play only.
- **No online multiplayer**: Strictly local single-device play.
- **No finish-rank tracking**: In Ludo and Snakes & Ladders, only the first-place winner is recognized; remaining positions are not computed.
- **No blockade rule in Ludo**: Stacking pieces does not form an impassable barricade for opponents.
- **Host SDK verification**: `flutter analyze` was verified on the host machine's Flutter/Dart SDK.

## Change Entry: Ludo "vs Computer" Mode

### Summary
Added an optional "vs Computer" mode to **Ludo only**. Snakes & Ladders and Carrom are completely untouched. Existing Ludo rules, mechanics, board, tokens, dice, animations, and multiplayer pass-and-play remain identical.

### Key Additions & Design
- **Mode Selection (`lib/screens/ludo_mode_select_screen.dart`)**:
  - Pushed after tapping Ludo on the home screen.
  - Presents two choices: "Multiplayer (Friends)" (the existing game and player dialog, unchanged) and "vs Computer".
  - Back arrow navigates back cleanly to Home Screen.
- **Dedicated vs Computer Layout & Shared Centered Dice**:
  - In vs Computer mode ONLY: The dice is horizontally centered in the bottom controls console, shared between Player 1 (Red human) and Player 2 (Yellow computer).
  - Multiplayer mode keeps its original corner dice position and layout completely intact.
  - Safe, responsive, and overflow-free across 360×640, 390×844, and 412×923 viewports.
- **Computer Player Logic (`lib/logic/ludo_computer_player.dart`)**:
  - Pure Dart AI acting strictly through `LudoController` methods (`rollDice`, `selectToken`).
  - Fair dice randomness: no cheating, no predicting rolls.
  - 600ms delay between actions.
  - Heuristic token selection: 1) move into HOME, 2) capture opponent, 3) bring token out with 6, 4) move to safe cell / out of danger, 5) advance furthest token.
  - Single legal token auto-moves for both human and CPU; 2+ tokens wait for manual tap choice for human.
  - Cancelable timers on screen dispose, game restart, or game over to guarantee no stale timers.
- **UI Indicators**:

## Change Entry: Carrom Rules Update (Coin Ownership, Points Scoring, Queen Cover & Winner Calculation)

### Summary
Updated ONLY Carrom game rules to implement colour-independent coin ownership, point-based scoring, universal queen cover, and empty-board final score winner determination.
**Zero modifications to Ludo or Snakes & Ladders**. Carrom physics, geometry, momentum, friction, collisions, striker positioning, aiming, animations, and responsive UI were 100% preserved.

### Carrom Rules Implemented
1. **Colour is NOT Player Ownership**:
   - Removed the restriction that players can only pocket their assigned colour.
   - Either player can pocket ANY remaining black or white coin.
   - The player who legally pockets a coin receives that coin's configured point value.
2. **Points-Based Scoring**:
   - Black coin = **10 points**
   - White coin = **20 points**
   - Queen = **50 points** (awarded when covered)
   - Winner is determined strictly by **total points**, not by number of coins pocketed or original colour.
   - A player with fewer coins can win with a higher total score (e.g., 3 white coins + Queen = 110 pts beats 10 black coins = 100 pts).
3. **Queen & Universal Cover**:
   - Queen may be pocketed by either player.
   - Cover may be **ANY valid coin (Black or White)**.
   - Existing cover requirement, failed cover return to center, and foul return logic remain fully intact.
4. **No Premature End on Colour Clearance**:
   - Clearing all 9 coins of an original baseline colour does NOT end the game while valid coins remain on the board.
   - Both players continue having chances until the board reaches its normal final board/end condition (all coins pocketed / empty board).
5. **Final Winner Calculation**:
   - When the board is empty, both players' total scores are calculated.
   - Highest total score wins; lower score loses.
   - Equal total score resolves as a Draw (preserving existing tie handling).
6. **Turns, Fouls & Computer Mode Compatibility**:
   - Pocketing any valid coin grants an extra shot. No coin pocketed passes the turn to the opponent.
   - Foul (striker pocketed) returns 1 previously pocketed coin to center as a penalty (Black coin first if available, else White coin) and turn passes to opponent.
   - `CarromComputerPlayer` targets any active non-striker coin on the board using the exact same rules and controls, receiving no unfair advantage.

## Change Entry: Pen Fight Game Implementation (5th Game in Suite)

### Summary
Added **Pen Fight** as the 5th game in the suite, completely isolated in `lib/pen_fight/`.
**Highest Priority Protection Upheld**:
- **Zero changes** to Ludo, Snakes & Ladders, Carrom, or Battleship (code, rules, physics, AI, navigation, UI, assets, or existing tests).
- All existing game tests pass completely and unchanged.
- No new external packages added to `pubspec.yaml`.
- The only pre-existing files modified were `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` (added 5th Pen Fight card and wrapped title in `Flexible` to eliminate horizontal RenderFlex overflow on small viewports), `README.md`, `CHANGE_REPORT.md`, and `test/home_screen_test.dart` (updated card expectation to 5 cards since it directly depends on Home Screen structure).

### Pen Fight Feature Specifications
1. **Home Screen**:
   - Added 5th "Pen Fight" card (`key: home_pen_fight_card`) with pen emoji (`🖊️`), category badge `TABLETOP`, tagline `2 players · Best of 3 rounds\nAim, flick & knock opponent off`, vivid violet accent color (`#8B5CF6`), and gradient `[#581C87, #7C3AED]`.
   - Layout scrolls smoothly in `SingleChildScrollView` with zero overflow across 360×640, 390×844, and 412×923 viewports.
2. **Mode Selection (`PenFightModeSelectScreen`)**:
   - Accessible from Home Screen card tap with back button (`pen_fight_mode_back_button`).
   - "Play with Friend" (`pen_fight_mode_2players`): 2 players, 1 device (pass-and-play).
   - "vs Computer" (`pen_fight_mode_vs_computer`): Player 1 (human) vs Player 2 (`CPU`).
3. **Tabletop & Physics Engine (`PenFightPhysics`, `PenFightConfig`)**:
   - Tabletop in virtual coordinates `400.0 × 600.0` with clear border and no walls.
   - Deterministic sub-stepped integration using fixed timestep (`1/60` s / 4 sub-steps).
   - Surface friction deceleration (`340.0 px/s²`) and viscous damping (`0.35`).
   - Elastic circle-to-circle momentum transfer collisions (`bounce = 0.82`).
   - Maximum speed capping (`1100.0 px/s`) preventing tunneling.
   - Off-table detection: pen is off table when its center passes any table edge (`x < 0 || x > 400 || y < 0 || y > 600`), triggering a short falling scale/fade animation.
   - All tuning numbers isolated in a single config file: `lib/pen_fight/pen_fight_config.dart`.
4. **Game Rules & Round Progression (`PenFightController`)**:
   - Drag backward from pen to aim and set flick power (capped at `powerCap = 1000.0`). Release to launch flick.
   - Turn passes only after all motion stops or max motion timeout (`3.5s`) is reached.
   - Round outcome rules:
     - Opponent pen falls off -> shooter wins the round.
     - Shooter's own pen falls off -> shooter loses the round.
     - Both pens fall off -> shooter loses the round.
   - Best of 3 rounds: first player to win 2 rounds wins the match.
   - Pens reset to initial positions between rounds.
5. **Computer Player AI (`PenFightComputerPlayer`)**:
   - Pure Dart AI using the exact same shot method as human players with zero hidden information.
   - Aims toward opponent pen, adds small random noise from seeded `Random` (`botError = 0.08` rad), calculates power from distance.
   - Edge proximity safety: reduces power when its own pen is near table edge to prevent flying off.
   - Realistic timing: waits 800ms (`botDelay`), shows aim trajectory for 400ms (`botAimDisplayMs`), then releases flick.
6. **Reliability & Input Protection**:
   - All inputs locked during motion, during CPU turns, between rounds, and after match end.
   - Only active shooter can drag; double-taps and duplicate drags ignored.
   - Timers and tickers cleanly disposed on screen exit, match restart, or game over.
7. **UI Components & Aesthetics**:
   - Reuses shared `WinnerBanner` from `lib/widgets/winner_banner.dart` without modifying it.
   - Reuses `AppButton`, `AppBackButton`, `AppCard`, and `AppDialog`.
   - Responsive layout verified on 360×640, 390×844, and 412×923 viewports.

## Pen Fight Upgrade: Realistic Physics, Pen Types, Fair Smart Bot & Balance Calibration

### 1. Realistic Rigid-Body Physics
- Replaced simplified circle collisions with capsule rigid bodies possessing mass, position, angle, velocity, angular velocity, and moment of inertia ($I = m \cdot (L^2 + W^2)/12$).
- Implemented segment-to-segment closest point distance detection with exact contact point derivation.
- Off-center hits generate torque ($\tau = r \times J$) causing natural rotation and spin; center hits produce negligible torque and slide straight. Hits near the end produce larger spin.
- Table edge balance: pen falls strictly when its center of mass passes the edge. Overhanging pens balance and pivot realistically due to asymmetric support friction torque.
- Sub-stepped impulse-based collision response with restitution ($e = 0.72$), tangential Coulomb friction ($\mu = 0.25$), and velocity/angular speed caps preventing tunneling.
- Turn passes only after both linear velocity and angular spin reach complete rest.

### 2. Fair Balance & Tuning
- Medium pull-back: max drag distance reduced to 77.0px (55% of original 140px).
- Gentle power curve exponent (1.25) provides fine control at low-to-medium drag, smoothly ramping to launch speed.
- Raised surface friction ($460.0$) and angular friction ($12.0$ rad/s$^2$) ensure realistic multi-turn matches where single-shot knockouts require accurate, strong hits.
- All numbers centralized in `pen_fight_config.dart`.

### 3. Pen Types (Stats Only)
- **Balanced**: Mass 1.0, length 72, width 14, power cap 600.
- **Heavy**: Mass 1.36, length 74, width 17, power cap 540 (thick, high mass, lower launch speed, barely moves when hit).
- **Slim**: Mass 0.76, length 70, width 11, power cap 680 (thin, low mass, high launch speed, pushed easily).
- Visual customization in `PenFightPainter`: distinct barrel thicknesses, clips, metallic bands, and nib shapes.
- Pre-match selection screen `PenFightPenSelectScreen`: turn-by-turn selection in Friend mode; seeded random CPU selection in vs Computer mode.

### 4. Fair, Smart Bot & Calibration
- Simulates candidate shots forward with physics engine using only publicly visible state.
- Generates 18 candidates: center shots, offset endpoint hits, edge-pushing angles, and safe repositioning shots when near table edges.
- Human-like fallibility: 15% mistake chance to select weaker/lower-tier shot, aim noise (~13.7°), and 18% power error.
- **Calibrated Win Rate**: Tested across 200 seeded matches of Bot vs Reference Player: **102 / 200 (51.0% win rate)**, meeting the 40–55% target.
- **Heavy vs Slim Balance**: Tested across 100 seeded matches: **40 / 100 (40.0% win rate)**, verifying neither side is favored beyond 60%.

## Pen Fight Upgrade: Robust Capsule Collisions, 50% Shorter Drag, 3 Auto-Switching Tables & Hazard-Aware AI

### 1. Robust Capsule-vs-Capsule Collision Engine (Top Priority Bug Fix)
- **Resolved Pass-Through Bug**:
  - Replaced center-proximity hit detection with true segment-to-segment closest point geometry between the two pen capsules.
  - Derived exact contact normal ($\vec{n}$) and symmetric contact point $\vec{p}_c = (\vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2) / 2$.
  - Fixed painter coordinate misalignment: `PenFightPainter._drawPen` rotated canvas by `pen.angle - math.pi / 2`, aligning visual pen nib with the physics forward vector $( \cos\theta, \sin\theta )$.
  - Applied full impulse with angular torque ($\tau = \vec{r} \times \vec{J}$) at the contact point: tip hits and glancing blows visibly spin and deflect the pen, while center hits slide it straight.
  - Positional correction separates overlapping pens proportionally by penetration depth along the contact normal.
- **Tunneling Prevention**:
  - Sub-stepped physics integration (10 sub-steps per 60Hz tick) ensures neither pen moves more than half its thickness per sub-step.
  - Linear velocity capped at 850 px/s and angular velocity capped at 32 rad/s.

### 2. Shorter Pull-Back Drag Distance
- Reduced `maxDragDistance` by ~50% from 77.0px to **38.5px** in `PenFightConfig`.
- Maintained identical launch power curve and full power cap values.
- Shortened drawn aim/pull lines in `PenFightPainter` (scaled proportionally $28\text{px} + \text{fraction} \times 72\text{px}$) with responsive power meter arc.

### 3. Three Tables with Automatic Round Switching
- **Table 1: Classic (Round 1)**: Square tabletop (420×420) with all edges open; pen falls when center of mass passes any edge.
- **Table 2: Hole (Round 2)**: Square tabletop with open edges plus a central circular hazard hole ($R = 38.0$ px); pen falls if its center of mass enters the hole.
- **Table 3: Rails (Round 3)**: Square tabletop with raised solid wooden rails on outer borders (restitution $0.65$ with tangential damping), leaving ONE open corner gap ($80.0\text{ px}$) at top-right ($x \ge 340, y \le 80$) where pens can fall.
- `PenFightTableType` enum with `forRound(int round)`, auto-advancing across Best-of-3 rounds.
- Responsive round announcement banner (`_showTableIntro`) displaying table name and rules at the start of each round.

### 4. CustomPainter Table Design & UI Polish
- **Pure CustomPainter**:
  - Beveled outer wooden frame with multi-toned bevel gradients and brass corner studs.
  - Varnished wood/felt playing surface with subtle woodgrain texture lines and soft tabletop shadow.
  - 3D Hole with brass bevel ring, radial shadow depth gradient, and lip shadow.
  - Raised wooden bumper rails with golden corner brackets and diagonal hazard warning stripes at the open corner gap.
- **Polished Responsive UI**:
  - Player cards showing pen type badge, round score dots, and glowing active turn indicator.
  - Zero overflow verified across compact (360×640), standard (390×844), and tall (412×923) viewports.

### 5. Hazard-Aware Smart Bot & Seeded Calibration
- **Table & Hazard Intelligence**:
  - Generates candidate shots avoiding self-fall into the hole on Hole Table and gap on Rails Table.
  - Adds lateral flanking candidates around the center hole when hole is in line of sight.
  - Adds tactical ghost-contact candidates targeting the center hole and the open corner gap to eliminate opponents.
- **Seeded Calibration Win Rates (100 Matches Per Table)**:
  - **Classic Table**: **43 / 100 (43.0%)** (Target: 40–55%)
  - **Hole Table**: **51 / 100 (51.0%)** (Target: 40–55%)
  - **Rails Table**: **50 / 100 (50.0%)** (Target: 40–55%)
